10 Hrs 


Have install fest prior to class

Addie Plan for Students - last 3 weeks


Make worksheet to work from basic Ubuntu image to:
1. g++ update

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install google-chrome-stable
to launch: google-chrome



The command to start Sublime Text: subl
Set up w/ Sublime text - already configured with helpful features of GitHub

Do Udacity JS and challenge

Bring Earbuds
Discuss watching JS in Host OS - FF or Guest OS FF; may be switching problems which preempts sound working properly.

When instructors talk you through the code, view the code on your laptop, using your tools.
Read the comments in index.html...
Use the sublime editor - to work on this - it has syntax highlighting...

Maybe a paper printout of index.html?



Light on HTML/CSS
refer to W3C schools for HTMl - may be a first workshop - and make a page
This is lightly introduced in Udacity JS course. references are useful to work through.
This is first case of "Earn your knowledge"
Also, consider working through lightly on CSS in W3C schools and links in Udacity Site

What is jQuery? -> Framework! :) 3rd party library

Build IDE to work seamlessly

Build web server (AWS or not) with students 

Lesson 0  - Quizzes
What is div?
What are strategies?
Have an open quiz?

2 tools
Text editor to code
Browser + developer tools - inspect the means the web sites load and run

Use Chrome dev Tools as essential to success
Install fest should require students to work through details of utilities install.
What are command statement to confirm correct install?

May have to replay lessons several times...

What is basic print command for JS?
Does JS require ;?
What is undefined?


$(".super-header-wrapper").html("<img style='width:100%' src='http://goo.gl/WCrBmS'>");

Which indicates that you are using jquery...

Local copy, not actual web site...
Instructors bounce back and forth between pages - stay nimble!

Resume Builder.js should have:
/*
This is empty on purpose! Your code to build the resume will go here.
 */
 $("#main").append("Joseph");
 
 The syntax in the video is sloppy - could be more precise..
 
The speed of light exercise was a mess...
Go over where to find web developer tools in FF and Chrome. May be easire to do in FF due to File Open.... ease.

Udacity JS course is pretty inconsistent:
Bounces back between log.console(), Udacity window interpreter and 
resumeBuilder.js changing web site

Truthy/Falsy are useful to work through..

There are NO classes in JS - you can have objects, but not classes.
Sort of like Python lists.

There may be value for students to wrestle through the exercises - productively lost.... however, it is right on the lije between grinding through and evoking confusion...

Work through CodeAcademy JS prior? Exclusive? How does W3C schools fir in. The newer ones are code centric but not design and web dev centric


 No need for var with .dot notation !! - adding properties to an object, NOT creating a new variable.
 
 dot and bracket notation are the same...
 when changing sections to backgroundColor = "black";
 it is difficult to see which sections will be used?
 
 the re notation for JS Problem Set 1 Protecting the Resume Section came out of the blue! Poorly Done.
 
 On Flow Control section, interesting application of === vs ==

 // ******************returned to HTML - need to complete portfolio 1

 Keep a reference list of useful sites to incorporate:
placeholder or placepuppy
 Google Fonts
 * means everything on the page

 Code -> test -> refine...
 Layout close -> then customize
